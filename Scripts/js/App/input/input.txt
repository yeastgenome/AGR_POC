SOI2		Suppressor of the rapid Onset of Impotence				Edition 13: Comments provided by J. Brickner: Suppressor of the rapid Onset of Impotence observed after shutting off the Kex2p localization-defective mutant Tyr713Ala. Mutations in the cytosolic tail of Kex2p, either deletion of the tail or substitution of Alanine for Tyr713, result in loss of TGN localization. Loss of Golgi retention results in a more rapid loss of mating competence of Mat alpha cells after shutting off expression of a GAL1 promoter-driven form of KEX2-Y713A. SOI2 mutants suppress the localization defect in Kex2p-Y713A and, unlike the parent strain, can mate well after 7h on glucose.	8887651 | 15090613

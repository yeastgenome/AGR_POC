# Alliance of Genome Resources Loader
An initial loader prototype for the web portal of the Alliance of Genome
Resources.

## Requirements
- Docker
- Docker-compose (can be installed via `pip`: `pip install docker-compose`).

## Installation
- Build the local environment image with `make buildenv`.
- Build the local image with `make build`.
- This repository has the agr_schemas as a submodule. Do the following the first time at checkout:
  - cd into schemas directory 
  - git init submodule
  - git submodule update (to fetch the actual data in this directory)
- Start the Neo4j database with `make startdb`. Allow ~10 seconds for Neo4j to initialize.
  - The Docker volume `agrloader_storedb` will be created (if it does not already exist).
  - To initialize an empty database after previously using the loader, be sure to run `make removedb` **before** running `make startdb`.

- git submodule update --init (on subsequent updates, run: git submodule update --remote` before merging changes to the `agr_loader` repo) 
  - currently, this submodule is tracking the 1.0.4 release - we need to change .gitmodules to reflect the next version when appropriate.

## Running the Loader
- Initialize a full load with `make run`.
- Alternatively, `make run_test` will launch a much smaller test load; this is useful for development and testing.

## Running Unit Tests
- Once the loader has been run (either test load or full load), unit tests can be executed via `make unit_tests`.

## Accessing the Neo4j Shell
- From your command line: `docker exec -ti neo4j.nqc bin/cypher-shell`
  - A quick command to count the number of nodes in your db: `match (n) return count (n);`

## Stopping and Removing the Database
- Once finished, stop the database with `make stopdb`.
- Optionally, remove the database with `make removedb`.

## Shortcut Commands
- `make reload` will re-run the `Installation` and `Running the Loader` steps from above.
- `make reload_test` will re-run the same steps using a test subset of data.
